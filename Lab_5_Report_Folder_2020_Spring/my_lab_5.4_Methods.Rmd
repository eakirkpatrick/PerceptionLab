# Methods

Here is how we did the experiment. Our basic design was to measure reaction time and probability of being correct under two different conditions: fear vs. joy and sad vs. happy. 

## Stimuli

We used some cool equipment

## Subjects

Lots of eager students served as subjects. We are happy that they volunteered.

## Procedure

We presented stimuli on nice Macintosh computers running PsychoPy [@peirce_psychopy_psychophysics_2007; @peirce_generating_2009; @peirce_building_2018; @peirce_psychopy2_2019] software.  First we trained the subjects, followed by a 25 hour testing session. No bathroom breaks were allowed.
