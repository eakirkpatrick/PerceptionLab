# Methods

DV= game performance, milliseconds
IV = control, erratic, contant {beeping at the same decibel} 

Two groups, each will be randomly assigned to erratic or constant beeping and will complete a game with headphones on

Between subjects factor- order of control and beeping 
Between subjects factors - type of beeping {erratic or constant}
	4 Groups 
Randomly assigned which task first 
Randomly assigned which order of beeping condition


Here is how we did the experiment. Our basic design was to measure reaction time and probability of being correct under two different conditions: fear vs. joy and sad vs. happy. 

## Stimuli

We used some cool equipment

## Subjects

Lots of eager students served as subjects. We are happy that they volunteered.

## Procedure

We presented stimuli on nice Macintosh computers running PsychoPy [@peirce_psychopy_psychophysics_2007; @peirce_generating_2009; @peirce_building_2018; @peirce_psychopy2_2019] software.  First we trained the subjects, followed by a 25 hour testing session. No bathroom breaks were allowed.
