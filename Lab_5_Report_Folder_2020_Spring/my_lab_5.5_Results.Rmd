Here are our results. You will be really impressed by our great graphs showing that our hypothesis was strongly supported by the results. We used bootstrapping procedures with `bootES` [@R-bootES] to estimate the size and reliablility of our main effect size. Cohen [-@cohen_statistical_1988; @cohen_things_1990] would be proud of us; we certainly are grateful for him. We also fitted a linear mixed-effects regression model to our data using the `lmer` function in the R-package `lme4`. We got happy F ratios. What great results we got.
