# Introduction

Here is why we did our experiment. We wanted to test a hypothesis to resolve an age old question.

The proposed experiment is seeking to determine the just noticeable auditory stimuli that a person hears while performing a task that has their attention. Previous research has shown that working memory for healthy people is not affected by distracting stimuli [@SAWAMURA2014].  Other research has shown that whenever audible stimulus occurs visual areas of the brain are turned off, focus on visual or audio information did not impact the reduction in activity in visual areas of the brain [@GAU2020].
